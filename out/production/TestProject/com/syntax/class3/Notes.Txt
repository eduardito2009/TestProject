  Casting: Is a process of converting a value from type to another
  we can cast primitive and non primitive
  2 type of casting:
   1) Widening/Implicit/Automatic.- Converting a value from small to big
   double d=10; automatic goes from int to double because we go from small to bigger
   byte->short->int->long->float->double
   2) Narrowing/Explicit/Manually.- Converting a value from big to small

Operators:
    assignment=

    arithmetical +, -, *, /, %

    relational and equality >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=
