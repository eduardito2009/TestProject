When we talk about class in Java we can have variables and methods, class will be the template, and we can create as
many object as we want.

If inside the class I want to create some variables what kind of variables we have?
We have 3 types
Local, instance, static
Difference between instance and static variables:Instance belong to the instance,
Name, lastName Speciality are instance variables
a copy of our instances variables will be sharing with all of our objects
Static holds one value
method Work(){"all doctors work at hospital"+ hospital};==>this is the method
print info(){ "doctor"+name+lastName+"is a"+speciality}; ==> this is another method
when we have many instance variables is best to use constructors
Constructor is needed to initialize the
Rules to create a constructor:
Constructor needs to have the same name of my variable
Local variable is:declare inside the class and inside a method or constructor and any block of code
this. keyword do is refers to current instance and can access variables and methods
this() means is when we try to call a parametrized constructor add variables inside parenthesis to fix it
Must specify to create a variable a dataType and a name
static keyword is a non access modifier and is optional to use, and also we can add access modifiers, but we don't need
to is optional

  Methods:Is a must for  Methods to have a returnType and a name
  non access modifiers

  Access Modifiers: 4 types
  most restricted private->default->protected->public
